/**
 * This package contains everything relating to Discord4J "modules". Modules are like addons to Discord4J, they add 
 * additional, optional features. While bots aren't required to use this module system, it is recommended as it allows
 * for multiple bots to work at the same time.
 * 
 * NOTE: Bot modules are still experimental and the workflow can still change.
