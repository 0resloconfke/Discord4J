# Discord4J  [![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/austinv11/Discord4J/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/austinv11/Discord4J/latest)

Java interface for the unofficial [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) API, written in Java 8.
[The API is also available in a few other languages.](https://blog.discordapp.com/the-robot-revolution-has-unofficially-begun/)

For the latest dev builds, [download it from my ci server.](https://drone.io/github.com/austinv11/Discord4J/files)

### Deprecation policy
Due to the nature of the discord api, any deprecations found in the api should not be expected to last past the current version. Meaning that if a method is deprecated on version 2.1.0, do not assume the method will be available in version 2.2.0.

### Development
The Discord API is still in development. Functions may break at any time.  
In such an event, please contact me or submit a pull request.

### Pull requests
No one is perfect at programming and I am no exception. If you see something that can be improved, please feel free to submit a pull request! 

### Other info
More information can be found in the [docs](https://discordapi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
